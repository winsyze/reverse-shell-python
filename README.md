# Reverse-Shell-Python
It's a simple Reverse Shell in Python to facilitate your life, for example: when escalating privileges.

# Reverse Shell Tool for Security Studies

**Note:** This tool has been developed exclusively for educational purposes and for use in controlled environments, such as authorized penetration testing or Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

## Description

This tool implements a reverse shell in Python 3 for the purpose of security information studies. It establishes a reverse network connection from a compromised system to a remote server, allowing users to explore typical scenarios of vulnerabilities involving the need for a reverse shell.

## Responsible Use

Please note that the use of this tool should be conducted in an ethical and legal manner. It is recommended that you obtain explicit permission before using the tool on any system or network. Unauthorized use of reverse shell techniques is illegal and violates the privacy and security of systems.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this tool include:

- Providing an implementation of a reverse shell in Python 3 for security studies.
- Facilitating practical understanding of vulnerabilities related to reverse shells.
- Supporting learning in controlled test environments, such as CTFs.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reverse-shell-tool.git
   ```

2. Run the tool with the following command:
